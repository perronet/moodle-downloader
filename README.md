# moodle-downloader
Simple bash script that downloads school material from moodle using wget's recursive download.
For now it only works with my university's Moodle page.

### Configuration
Download everything, open the configuration file and follow the instructions.
After completing the configuration, run the script with:
```
./moodledownloader.sh
```
Doesn't start? Try:
```
chmod +x moodledownloader.sh
```
Then try to run it again.
